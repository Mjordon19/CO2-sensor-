# CO2-sensor

Welcome!
We're working on a way to get a valid CO2 reading

Basic things to know:
  - The CO2 sensor is an analog sensor and uses the same pins the other analog sensors use(analog pins 0-7)
  - When plugged in, the CO2 sensor gets really hot so be careful
  - When properly working it should give you a new reading when it senses breath.   
 Good luck!
